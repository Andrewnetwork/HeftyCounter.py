HeftyNumber is a library built upon Numpy for doing arithmetic in arbitrary bases with arbitrary precision. 

I hope that this library will shape up to be a useful tool for anyone studying number theory, combinatorics, or 
numerical optimization. 

**!This repo is under heavy development, please don't take anything as final or refined!**

## Features
* Effortless base conversion. 
* Vector representation of large numbers. 
* Ability to count in any base. 

## Ratonale & History
Coming soon.
